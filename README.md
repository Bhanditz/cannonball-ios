# Cannonball for iOS

This repository contains the source code for Cannonball, an iOS application written in Swift built with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

Cannonball is the fun way to create and share stories and poems on your phone. Start with a beautiful image from the gallery, then choose words about #adventure, #romance, #nature or #mystery to complete the story and share it with friends.
